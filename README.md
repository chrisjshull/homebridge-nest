Nest plug-in for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) using the native Nest API. See what's new in [release 4.4.6](https://github.com/chrisjshull/homebridge-nest/releases/tag/v4.4.6).

Integrate your Nest Thermostat (including Nest Temperature Sensors), Nest Protect, and Nest x Yale Lock devices into your HomeKit system. Both Nest Accounts (pre-August 2019) and Google Accounts are supported.

Currently, homebridge-nest supports all Nest Thermostat, Protect, and Nest x Yale Lock models, now including the EU/UK model of the Thermostat E with Heat Link.

# Starling Home Hub

If you want a plug-and-play Nest integration solution, check out [Starling Home Hub](https://www.starlinghome.io). It's basically "homebridge-nest in a box" and connects to your home router, so you'll be up and running in minutes without needing to set up a Homebridge server or manually edit configuration files. Starling Home Hub also supports Nest Cameras and Nest Secure.

If you want a DIY solution, then read on, as homebridge-nest is for you!

# Installation

<!-- 2. Clone (or pull) this repository from github into the same path Homebridge lives (usually `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`). Note: the code currently on GitHub is in beta, and is newer than the latest published version of this package on `npm` -->
1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plug-in using: `npm install -g homebridge-nest`
3. Update your configuration file. See example `config.json` snippet below.

# Configuration

Configuration sample (edit `~/.homebridge/config.json`):

```
"platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "Nest",
            "access_token": "your Nest Account access token"
        }
    ],
```

Required fields when using a Nest Account with an access token: (see below for set-up info)

* `"platform"`: Must always be `"Nest"`
* `"access_token"`: Nest service access token

Required fields when using a Google Account: (see below for set-up info)

* `"platform"`: Must always be `"Nest"`
* `"googleAuth"`: Google authentication information

Optional fields:

* `"structureId"`: `"your structure's ID"` // optional structureId to filter to (see logs on first run for each device's structureId) - Nest "structures" are equivalent to HomeKit "homes"
* `"options"`: `[ "feature1", "feature2", ... ]` // optional list of features to enable/disable (see 'Feature Options' below)
* `"fanDurationMinutes"`: number of minutes to run the fan when manually turned on (optional, default is 15)

# Using a Nest Account

To use a Nest Account with homebridge-nest, you will need to obtain an access token from the Nest web app. (Note - no Nest developer account is required.) Simply go to `https://home.nest.com` in your browser and log in. Once that's done, go to `https://home.nest.com/session` in your browser, and you will see a long string that looks like this:

```
{"2fa_state":"not_enrolled","access_token":"XXX","email":"...","expires_in":"...", ...}
```

Simply set `"access_token"` in your `config.json` file under the `"platform": "Nest"` entry to the value of `access_token` in the above string (the `XXX`), which will be a long string of letters and numbers and punctuation. Do not log out of `home.nest.com`, as this will invalidate your credentials. Just close the browser tab.

# Using a Google Account

Google Accounts (mandatory for new Nest devices after August 2019, with an optional migration for earlier accounts) are now supported. Setting up a Google Account with homebridge-nest is a pain, but only needs to be done once, as long as you don't log out of your Google Account.

Google Accounts are configured using the `"googleAuth"` object in `config.json`, which contains three fields, `"issueToken"`, `"cookies"` and `"apiKey"`, and looks like this:

```
      "platform": "Nest",
      "googleAuth": {
        "issueToken": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/iframerpc?action=issueToken...",
        "cookies": "OCAK=TOMPYI3cCPAt...; SID=ogftnk...; HSID=ApXSR...; ...; SIDCC=AN0-TYt...",
        "apiKey": "AIzaS..."
      },
```

The values of `"issueToken"`, `"cookies"` and `"apiKey"` are specific to your Google Account. To get them, follow these steps (only needs to be done once, as long as you stay logged into your Google Account).

1. Open a Chrome browser tab in Incognito Mode (or clear your cache).
2. Open Developer Tools (View/Developer/Developer Tools).
3. Click on 'Network' tab. Make sure 'Preserve Log' is checked.
4. In the 'Filter' box, enter `issueToken`
5. Go to `home.nest.com`, and click 'Sign in with Google'. Log into your account.
6. One network call (beginning with `iframerpc`) will appear in the Dev Tools window. Click on it.
7. In the Headers tab, under General, copy the entire `Request URL` (beginning with `https://accounts.google.com`, ending with `nest.com`). This is your `"issueToken"` in `config.json`.
8. In the 'Filter' box, enter `oauth2/iframe`
9. Several network calls will appear in the Dev Tools window. Click on the last `iframe` call.
10. In the Headers tab, under Request Headers, copy the entire `cookie` (**include the whole string which is several lines long and has many field/value pairs** - do not include the `cookie:` name). This is your `"cookies"` in `config.json`.
11. In the 'Filter' box, enter `issue_jwt`
12. Click on the last `issue_jwt` call.
13. In the Headers tab, under Request Headers, copy the entire `x-goog-api-key` (do not include the `x-goog-api-key:` name). This is your `"apiKey"` in `config.json`.
14. Do not log out of `home.nest.com`, as this will invalidate your credentials. Just close the browser tab.

# HomeKit Accessory Types

## Home

* *Switch* accessory (Home Occupied) indicating detected Home/Away state - can be manually changed

## Nest Thermostat (+ Temperature Sensors)

* *Thermostat* accessory with ambient temperature and humidity sensors, mode control (heat/cool/auto/off), and target temperature control
* *Switch* accessory (Eco Mode) for turning on and off Eco Mode
* *Fan* accessory for controlling the fan (except the EU/UK model of the Nest Thermostat E, which does not have a fan control)
* *TemperatureSensor* accessory indicating the ambient temperature at the thermostat (disabled by default if no Temperature Sensors are present - temperature is reported by the base *Thermostat* accessory)
* *TemperatureSensor* accessory indicating the ambient temperature where each additional Nest Temperature Sensor is located
* *HumiditySensor* accessory indicating the relative humidity at the thermostat (disabled by default - humidity is reported by the base *Thermostat* accessory)

## Nest Protect

* *SmokeSensor* accessory (Smoke) indicating smoke detected
* *CarbonMonoxideSensor* accessory (Carbon Monoxide) indicating CO detected
* *MotionSensor* accessory (Motion) indicating motion detected near the Protect device (AC wired Protects only)

## Nest x Yale Lock

* *LockMechanism* accessory

# Feature Options

Set `"options"` in `config.json` to an array of strings chosen from the following to customise feature options:

* `"Thermostat.Disable"` - exclude Nest Thermostats from HomeKit
* `"Thermostat.Fan.Disable"` - do not create a *Fan* accessory for the thermostat
* `"Thermostat.Eco.Disable"` - do not create a *Switch* accessory to indicate/control Eco Mode status
* `"Thermostat.SeparateBuiltInTemperatureSensor.Enable"` - create an additional *TemperatureSensor* accessory to report the ambient temperature at the thermostat
* `"Thermostat.SeparateBuiltInHumiditySensor.Enable"` - create an additional *HumiditySensor* accessory to report the relative humidity at the thermostat
* `"Thermostat.EcoMode.ChangeEcoBands.Enable"` - when set, changing temperature in Eco Mode changes Eco Temperature Bands (default is to turn off Eco Mode instead before setting temperature)
* `"TempSensor.Disable"` - exclude Nest Temperature Sensors from HomeKit
* `"HomeAway.Disable"` - exclude Home/Away switch from HomeKit
* `"HomeAway.AsOccupancySensor"` - create Home/Away indicator as an *OccupancySensor* instead of a *Switch* - useful for automations
* `"HomeAway.AsOccupancySensorAndSwitch"` - create Home/Away indicator as an *OccupancySensor* and a *Switch*
* `"Protect.Disable"` - exclude Nest Protects from HomeKit
* `"Protect.MotionSensor.Disable"` - disable *MotionDetector* accessory for Nest Protects
* `"Lock.Disable"` - exclude Nest x Yale Locks from HomeKit
* `"Nest.FieldTest.Enable"` - set this option if you're using a Nest Field Test account (experimental)

By default, options set apply to all devices. To set an option for a specific device only, add `.device_id` to the corresponding `option`, where `device_id` is shown in the Homebridge logs, or in HomeKit itself as *Serial Number* in the Settings page for your device. For example, to disable one specific thermostat with serial number 09AC01AC31180349, add `"Thermostat.Disable.09AC01AC31180349"` to the `"options"` array.

# Things to try with Siri

* Hey Siri, *set the thermostat to cool*. (try heat, cool, auto, or off)
* Hey Siri, *turn on the air conditioning*.
* Hey Siri, *turn Eco Mode on*.
* Hey Siri, *what's the temperature at home*?
* Hey Siri, *what's the temperature in the Basement*? (get the temperature from a Nest Temperature Sensor)
